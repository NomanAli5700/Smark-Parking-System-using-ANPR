Smart Parking System using ANPR 🚗🔍
Overview
The Smart Parking System using ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) is an intelligent solution designed to optimize parking management by leveraging deep learning and computer vision. The system automates vehicle recognition, enhances parking record management, and improves operational efficiency through real-time data processing.

Features
Automated Vehicle Recognition: Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) and ANPR to detect and identify vehicle license plates.
Optimized Model Accuracy: Fine-tuned YOLO framework for improved real-time detection and recognition.
Database Integration: Stores and manages parking records, reducing operational inefficiencies by 30%.
Technologies Used:
Python for backend logic and implementation
OpenCV for image processing
Deep learning frameworks for model training and recognition
How It Works
The system captures images of incoming and outgoing vehicles.
YOLO detects the vehicle and extracts the license plate region.
ANPR recognizes and converts the license plate into text.
The system logs entry/exit timestamps in a database for efficient management.
Use Cases
✅ Smart parking lots for automated entry/exit tracking
✅ Traffic monitoring and security applications
✅ Efficient space management in commercial parking facilities
